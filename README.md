## What is CodeIgniter?
CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible, and secure. More information can be found at the [official site](http://codeigniter.com).

This repo holds the pre-alpha code for CodeIgniter 4 only. Version 4 is a complete rewrite to bring the quality and the code into a more modern version, while still keeping as many of the things intact that has made people love the framework over the years. 

**This is pre-release code and should not be used in production sites.**

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [the announcement](http://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-62615.html) on the forums.

## Contributing
We are not accepting contributions from the public until a stable enough base has been formed, and our plans fleshed out and things settle down a little bit. At that point, we will welcome your comments and help creating the best framework for our community.

## Server Requirements
PHP version 7 or higher is required. 

## Running CodeIgniter Tests

Information on running CodeIgniter test suite can be found in the README.md file in the tests directory.
