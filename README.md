# CodeIgniter 4 Development
This repo contains work that may or may not make it into the official version of CodeIgniter. 

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [the announcement](http://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-62615.html) on the forums.

## Contributing
We are not accepting contributions from the public until a stable enough base has been formed, and our plans fleshed out and things settle down a little bit. At that point, we will welcome your comments and help creating the best framework for our community.

## Server Requirements
PHP version 7 is required. 

You can obtain a working Vagrant box from Rasmus Lerdorf [here](https://github.com/rlerdorf/php7dev).
